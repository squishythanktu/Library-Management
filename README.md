# ðŸ“šLibrary-Management
This is the second project in my university, which I collab with @Imsimonn! <br/>
Topic: The library management system reads data from .txt files, including many functions: add books, delete books, search books, borrow books, return books, view library, view invoices, manage accounts...<br/>
